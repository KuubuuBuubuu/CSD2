"""
An example project in which a rhythmical sequence (one measure, 1 sample) is played.
  - Sixteenth note is the smallest used note duration.
  - One meassure, time signature: 3 / 4

Instead of using steps to iterate through a sequence, we are checking the time.
We will trigger events based on a timestamp.

------ HANDS-ON TIPS ------
- Run the code, read the code and answer the following question:
  - This script transforms a list of 'sixteenth notes timestamps' into a list of
    regular timestamps.
    In the playback loop, the time difference (currentTime minus startTime)
    is compared to the upcomming timestamp.
    Why is this a more accurate method then the methods used in the examples
    "04_randomNoteDuration.py" and "05_oneSampleSequenceSteps.py"?
    Notate your answer below this line (Dutch is allowed)!
    -----
    The other two examples play the sound file - which takes a small amount of
    time to run that code - before the next part of the code is being processed.
    In this code, the timestamp remains constant, and it checks if the file
    needs to be played. This eliminates that latency.
    -----

- Alter the code:
  Currently one sample is played. Add another sample to the script.
  When a sample needs to be played, choose one of the two samples
  randomly.
  (See the hint about the random package in script "02_timedPlayback".)

- Alter the code:
  Currently the sequence is only played once.
  Alter the code to play it multiple times.
  hint: The timestamps list is emptied using the pop() function.
  (multiple possible solutions)
